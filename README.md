## Codename: Hearts
Built with the same base as *Whist* project, only this time it is Hearts. The game is basically the same however heuristic for AI was written using different set of rules.

_Please note that this is a work in progress and should at all times be buildable, but with limited functionality
that will be increasing as I develop the game in my spare time.  I have a full-time job developing software in C#.Net
and am kept quite busy with work projects._
